### Class Taken:

#### [Georgia Institute of Technology]

###### CS 1332: Data Structure and Algorithms, Grade A

###### CS 2110: Computer Organization and Programming

* basic hardware concepts, Von Neumann model, operation of data path, machine language, symbolic assembly language, basic concepts of OS (runtime stack, I/O), C with emphasis on assembly , machine language and interaction with hardware. 

###### CS 2200: Introduction to Computer Architecture and Networks, Grade A

*  Organization of the processor, memory hierarchy, storage devices, parallel processors, networking hardware, software abstraction in OS, networking protocol 
* A class assignment in this course was to build a pipeline processor with logical circuit, from scratch. It's really not that "introduction". Very intense, very helpful and very proud of it.

### Research Experience:

#### [UW]

##### Ubicomp Group - PI: Shwetak Patel,

 * Developing a wearable monitoring device for patients suffering from migraine. The device monitors environmental triggers, geographical location and other causes related to migraine onset, learn the user's activity routine, and alert the user when him/her is likely to experience migraine onset. 

##### Clinical Informatics Research Group - PI: Bill Lober

* Developing mPOWEr,a webapp used by patient for post-surgical infection assessment. Current role includes developing python on Flask API as backend and angular JS frontend. 

#### [Georgia Tech]

##### E-Archery - PI: Thad Starner

 * Developed a wearable archery training device system consisted of a glove and compatible Android app that detects archer’s hand motion, performs form classification, and gives feedback regarding the archer’s form.

##### Integration of Multi-Modal RNA-Seq Data for Prediction of Pancreatic Cancer Grade - PI: May Wang

* Developed a classifier to identify pancreatic cancer grade using genomic and proteomic data from the
  National Cancer Genome Atlas.

##### AirGuard: Home-Use Lung Function Monitoring Device - Sponsor: Micro-C Imaging

* Developed a at-home lung function monitoring device for chronic lung disease patients that quantifies air flow rate and gas components of the breathe and conducts test validity check.
